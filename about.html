                <p>Hillside High School is a unique school that provides extraordinary opportunities for its students. These programs cross a wide spectrum including Durham's only IB program, Army JROTC, a thriving drama department, and sports teams that excel. Hillside's website says they are committed "to inspire students to become globally aware citizens, lifelong learners, and responsible leaders in their communities. This will be accomplished by creating challenging learning experiences that emphasize collaboration, critical thinking, and respect for all people."</p>
                <p>The Duke class is called Documentary Photography: Education, Childhood and Growth. Each Duke student spent the fall semester documenting one story, either about an individual, a program or a sport. Duke students produced audio-visual slide shows as well as large final prints for a public exhibit for the students, families, and staff. The website and all prints were donated to the school as a gift. The students want to lend their support for the hard work teachers and staff put in every day to educate the children of Durham.</p>
                <p>We are grateful to everyone at Hillside: the many teachers, staff, students and parents! Thank you for letting us Focus on Hillside!</p>
