				<p>As an Alumni of Hillside High School it has been my pleasure to return and photograph some of the things that make our school special. At Hillside I always recognized that football program was an integral part of our identity - both as a player and a student. Football is able to transcend the challenges that we may face on a daily basis and transports us to a place where the entire Hillside family can come and celebrate.</p>
                <p>The players in particular know the importance of what they do, as leaders both on and off the field. I followed David Madzivanyika a players whose exceptional performance truly embodies what it means to be a Hillside Football player. Yet despite my focus, I have to thank all of the players, coaches, and athletic assistants who make every game possible. Returning to Hillside I have had the chance to showcase what makes the game special, and how it can change you forever.</p>
