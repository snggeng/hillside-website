				<p>Hillside High School senior, Jordan Griffith, a recently licensed pilot, is ready to take off towards the future he wants. After years of long-term planning and meticulous time management, he has finally turned his passions into reality - he loves being in the air. As a student, Jordan juggles school work, football, aviation and flying to make this extraordinary achievement.</p>
                <p>Photographing Jordan's life was one of the most rewarding experiences of my time at Duke, especially those moments of going up in the air with him. I was extremely lucky to know Jordan because I learned a lot about him as a person and his passion for flying as well as aviation in general. Jordan is only seventeen, but he is one of the most mature people I have ever met in his age. His sense of care for others' wellbeing and kindness is something we all should look up to.</p>
                <p>I want to thank Jordan for welcoming me and allowing me to photograph his experiences in this particular time of his life. I admire his hard work, determination, and success. My thank also goes to Ms. Griffith, who welcomed me to their house and shared many of their stories with me.</p>
