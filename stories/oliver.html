                <p>Hillside High School has an incredible Student Government Association, due in part to the leadership of president Jalen McKoy. SGA works hard to ensure that their events are fun and engaging for every student, and every member of SGA understands the importance and gravity of their positions. Jalen in particular devotes his all to SGA, as he does with all of his extracurriculars. Jalen is an exceptional student, leader, friend, and son.</p>
                <p>I want to extend my sincerest thanks to every member of SGA and Ms. Caddell. I saw how hard they worked so that other students could enjoy themselves, and it paid off - they're incredibly successful in everything they do. Every member was so kind and welcoming me to me, and I appreciated the inside look into their organization. I also want to thank Jalen's family, friends, classmates, and castmates for their generosity and willingness to be photographed. Finally, I want to thank Jalen for his kindness, graciousness, and flexibility. He was willing to let me into every part of his life, and it made my job so easy and enjoyable. I loved working on this project and I am so grateful for the opportunity to have meet so many of the amazing people at Hillside High School.</p>
