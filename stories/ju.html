				<p>There is something peculiar about how relationships are formed; it always feels that the most meaningful interactions and friendships arise when we least expect it. Going into Hillside to photograph the IB program for the first time, I thought I knew what type of subjects and topics I wanted to cover. I wanted stock photos of studious students handling lab equipment, a defining interaction between a student and I that would cement a life-long friendship, you know, the stuff of tear-jerking movies.</p>
                <p>Instead, I met some awesome people who, as corny as this sounds, surpassed all my expectations. I met students like Josephus and Elijah, who leave me questioning why I was such a passionless and uninspired vegetable in high school. I met teachers and faculty like Ms. McKoy and Ms. Amihere who showed me what having a good relationship with faculty feels like. I wish this photographic essay could do these folks justice, but it can't - there isn't a tear-jerking movie that could. Because those people on screen are just characters, but these students, teachers, and faculty at Hillside? They're the best of real life.</p>
                <p>Wishing YOU ALL, the best!</p>
                <p>Andy</p>
